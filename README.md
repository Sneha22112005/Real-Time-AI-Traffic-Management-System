# Real-Time-AI-Traffic-Management-System
This project uses AI and computer vision to detect and count vehicles in traffic camera videos in real time. It helps reduce traffic jams and pollution by analyzing vehicle flow and optimizing signals. The system uses Python, YOLOv8, and OpenCV for fast and accurate monitoring. It's a smart solution to make city traffic greener and more efficient
